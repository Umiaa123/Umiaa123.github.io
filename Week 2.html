<h1>Week 2</h1>
<h2> Umia Jones-Watson</h2>


<p>John Berger</p>

<body>John Berger has a great way of defining how we see the world. In episode 1, he explains how the camera is kind of like the eye of the beholder. The camera sees the world like no other can see the world. It has changed the way we see time, and even paintings by having these thing exist for prolong periods of time instead of real time. The way we sees things have different perspectives to think on. In episode 2, he talks about women and how we areperived in the world by men. We hav to look a certain way when it comes to our hair, makeup, clothing, and etc to be admired by. Or at least, trying the different definitions of being naked/nude. Episodes 3 and 4 contines withthey way we see things through everyday life,paintings, billboards, drawings, looking in the mirror and more.</body>
